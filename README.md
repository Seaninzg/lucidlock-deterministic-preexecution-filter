Deterministic Structural Pre-Execution Filtering with Guaranteed Violation Reporting

This repository contains the public defensive disclosure and patent support materials for the LucidLock supplemental patent titled:

Deterministic Structural Pre-Execution Filtering with Guaranteed Violation Reporting

The disclosed invention defines a deterministic, structural pre-execution filtering mechanism for language-mediated computational systems. It enforces execution gating based on non-semantic structural risk, guarantees audit-complete refusal outcomes, and treats non-interpretation as an enforced security property.

📜 Disclosure Purpose

This repository exists to:

establish public prior art

support defensive disclosure

preserve authorship and structural origin

provide a stable reference for patent, licensing, and audit contexts

No implementation code, models, thresholds, or scoring logic are disclosed.

🔒 Scope of the Disclosure

The disclosed system:

evaluates natural language inputs prior to execution, simulation, or tool invocation

uses multiple isolated structural evaluators

enforces deterministic verdict escalation (no averaging or probabilistic reconciliation)

guarantees audit-complete refusal outcomes, including fallback violation reporting

explicitly refuses semantic interpretation, decoding, normalization, or expansion as a security property

The system does not perform:

content moderation

intent attribution

adaptive learning

semantic analysis

model training or fine-tuning

🧱 Patent Context

This disclosure forms part of the LucidLock patent family and serves as a supplemental filing closing specific gaps related to:

deterministic escalation enforcement

guaranteed violation reporting

non-interpretation as a security mechanism

It complements, but does not replace, earlier LucidLock filings covering coercion detection, volitional inference, and pre-execution interception.
